# Keychain
Keychain is a password manager to separate passwords from Google Password Manager so it won't be all in one place for hackers to find.

# How to set up Keychain (Windows 8.1+)
1. Click Code and click download zip and receive Keychain-main.zip
2. Open File Explorer, find the zip, and extract all.
3. Then open the folders to find the files.
4. At the top where the file location is, click on it until you can start typing and type 'cmd' until Command Prompt opens.
5. Then if you have Python, type this command, "python -m http.server 8000". (8000 can be changed to almost any number.)
6. Open up your browser, eg Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge.
7. Then go to localhost:8000 or whatever you set the numbers to.
8. Do the set up to make a master password.
9. Login with the master password (and we recommend writing this down on a notepad away from your webcam).
10. Add your entries/passwords.
11. Enjoy and be safe!
